<h1>An article on Animal Abuse</h1>
<p class="double"><b>A</b>re we compassionate towards animals?<br>
Are we kind to all kinds?<br>
we not abusing animal in any form?<br>
Lets Think!Animal abuse is being cruel, causing distress to<br>
an animal deliberetely or carelessly which encompasses<br>
 physical sign in an animal such as loss of fur, wounds that are left untreated;<br>
environmental signs such as changing its habitat, lack of food<br>
 and shelter,left in an unclean environment and others.<br>
 The most commonly abused animals are dogs, cats, horses, and farm animals.<br>
 Do animals feel pain an emotions as human do? Yes. the animals feels pain and emotions</b><br>
 and also love to play.Then, why are these creatures abused?<br>
 Absolutely for their skin, meat, and valubale parts of animals for embellishing<br>
 our homes and industrial purpose.I feel that ADEP is a simple mantra to<br>
 stop animal abuse<br>

 <p class="ADEP"><b>A-</b>Adopt an animal<br>
<b>D-</b>Donate your valubale time and money<br>
<b>E-</b>Educate your Kith and Kin<br>
<b>P-</b>Purchase animal cruelty-free products</p>

<p class="hero">Let's think about how we speak about animals.Sice the animals have life,<br>
     let's refer to them as 'He/She' instead of referring to 'It'. we can also<br>
      volunteer to serve animal welfare or oraganisation and pledge to treat<br>
       animalswith kindness</p>
